# ATMEGA328P Basic PCB for Eagle CAD

Schematic and PCB files for a basic example of an ATMEGA328P (Arduino Uno) using cadsoft's EagleCAD. The purpose is of this is just to help first time PCB makers start with a basic example.

The board needs to be externally powered with ~9volts DC, you can use either a L4931-5.0 (available at adafruit) or an LM7805 voltage regulator. Either one needs to be TO-92 format/size.

The schematic is meant to be fairly generic, there is a potentiometer that can be read on analog pin 0. LEDS are on pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11
